# configurations for rubocop gem to exclude specified files and parameters
# when performing autocorrect function to correct formatting/styling
# since majority of styling was already according to convention, majority
# of corrects were from trailing whitespace, indentation of 4 spaces rather
# than 2, and having new line at end of file and after guard clauses
# (i.e. break and next)
